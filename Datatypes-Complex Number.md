# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `num1` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `num2` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(num1, num2)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program
```
num1=int(input())
num2=int(input())
x=complex(num1,num2)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
